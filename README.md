pystockgame
===========

I intend to make a networked stock trading game while learning python.  We'll see how this goes.

I am new to computer programming. So everything I will do is likely to be wrong. For this I'd like to apologize. 

Here's the gist: I want to make a LAN based multi-player stock market simulation using python and curses.  I plan to break the game up into n-minute trading rounds where the players are free to Buy/Sell/Short the available stocks, and take loans.  When the round is over, there will be a break for a custom events ticker, and then the next round of trading will begin. 

That's the idea anyhow... 

What I've learned so far: 
- [x] Basic python syntax. 
- [x] Variables and using them. 
- [x] Importing curses.
- [x] Defining a window and drawing some lines, strings, and variables (as strings) into it. 

What I would like to learn (Short Term) 

- [ ] Dynamically sizing the curses screen (Down to a minimum size to be determined.) 
- [ ] Interaction (Specifically highlighting the ticker/price rows a row at at time with the up and down keys.) 
- [ ] Using panel to facilitate complex interactions (Specifically, selecting highlighted row with the Enter key, and floating a new "window" in the center of the screen.) 
 
Inspiration for this game comes from Scott Adams' (The Creator of Dilbert) 1987 DOS Game "Black Monday".
